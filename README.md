BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
Bookbot was a simple guided project from Boot.dev (https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend).
Due to the nature of the project I have brainstormed a List of upgrade ideas to be implemented at a later date. 

Implemented Upgrades:

TODO: Upgrade list:
1. CLI that lets you send it the .txt file you want analyzed
    - Needs to have arguments that can change your file report
    - Regex argument??
2. Outputs a txt file report that looks good and contains the data from the file 
3. Option to run this program as a GUI 
    - Need to be able to select file and make choices on types of analysis
    - Default output option is to a save text file but we should let the report be previewed in another window
